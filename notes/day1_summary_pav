WFS Hackathon Day 1 summary
  - participated in intro and admin stuff with Scott, Clemens and Chris
  - fleshed WFS 3.0 server a bit more, expecially adding more of the OpenAPI
    generation code
  - participated in discussion about show schemas (i.e. extension to core)
    should be exposed through the api
    - several approaches discussed
      - use OpenAPI itself to express feature schema
      - use hypermedia links to point to feature schema
      - has a dedicated /schema & /schema/{collectionName} paths
    - implements the /schema & /schema/{collectionName} in my WFS 3.0 server
      to test the approach
  - participated in discussion related to reorganizing the server paths
    slightly (see: https://github.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/issues/64)
