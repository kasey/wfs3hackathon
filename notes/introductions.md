## Participants

**Even Rouault**: Core GDAL developer, implemented WFS 1.0, 1.1, 2.0 client in GDAL/OGR, upgraded QGIS WFS client to 
support WFS 1.1 and 2.0, and upgraded MapServer WFS client to support WFS 2.0. Topic of interest for this hackaton will be to 
develop an experimental WFS 3.0 client in GDAL/OGR.

**Philippe Duchesne**: Background is 10+ years spent on the implementation of the OGC specs. Experimentation with REST portage
of CSW. For the hackathon he's working on a WFS3 js client integrated in a linked data portal, using so far 
https://www.ldproxy.nrw.de as a test platform.
Looking forward to integrating further features of the spec, in particular those that allow a true linked data approach :
 - support for content-type negotiation using HTTP headers
 - 'Link' HTTP headers that link a feature URL to its collection/service description
