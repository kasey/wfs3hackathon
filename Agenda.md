# WFS 3.0 Hackathon - Draft Agenda

This is an initial draft agenda for the Hackathon. The agenda will be adapted as necessary during the event.

We plan to share at least the initial and final sessions - marked with `[Remote]` and with their scheduled start time - with remote participants using GoToMeeting. However, we cannot guarantee if there will be remote web conferencing capabilities just yet. 

All times are in Mountain Standard Time (UTC -7h).
