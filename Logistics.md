# WFS 3.0 Hackathon - Logistics

## Travel

Fort Collins is about an hour from the Denver International Airport. Denver is a major airport with good domestic and international connections (see: http://www.flydenver.com).

These are the two best ways to get from the airport to Fort Collins:

1. Shuttle services through Green Ride: http://greenrideco.com/. The shuttle drops passengers at the Hilton Hotel (recommended hotel) and runs on about an hourly schedule for $28 each way.
2. Car rental: exit the airport on Pena Blvd. and take the exit for E-470 toward Fort Collins. At I-25, exit North for Fort Collins and stay on I-25 for about 40 miles.

## Hotel 

We recommend staying at the Hilton Hotel as it is a short walk to the Hackathon: http://www3.hilton.com/en/hotels/colorado/hilton-fort-collins-FNLCOHF/index.html.

There are plenty of other hotels in town, some of which are convenient to the Max bus which runs very close to the venue (http://www.ridetransfort.com/max).

## Venue

U.S. Geological Survey Fort Collins Science Center  
Powell Center  
2150 Centre Avenue  
Building C  
Fort Collins, CO 80526

## Meals

Breakfast, lunch, and breaks will be provided. We will have hosted drinks and dinner the night of the 6th. Good food is available a block East of the Hilton, including the two best taquerias (places that serve tacos, if you did not know!) in town, good sushi, and a great brewery (https://blackbottlebrewery.com/).

## Getting Around

Public transport can get you to Old Town (the downtown area). Going further afield requires a car or bike. Fort Collins does have a great bike library (https://www.fcbikelibrary.org) for free use, although only the Old Town location is likely to be open in March.
